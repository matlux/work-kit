## Slide 0 - Spark presentation

Thanks for joining this presentation on Spark.



## Slide - Agenda
Today I would like to cover the following:
In particular cover what is Spark good at? Why is the business interested in it?
Kevin last week gave a presentation on Distributed computing.
I want to take it further... and show how it compares to Grid Server in the realm of Distributed computing.

* Why Spark ? (What is it good at?) (Why is the business and ACX interested in it?)
* Origins of Spark
* Spark's Features
* How does it compare to Grid Computing

Without further ado

## Slide 1 - Crunching numbers

But before I go too far on the subject, let's trace back the origin of Spark let's get back to the beginning

## Slide 1 - In the beginning god created...

I want to ask you a question. What was there at the beginning before Spark?

If we go back really really far back in time...

## Slide 2 - First computer

It was really dark time

## Slide 3 - Vertical scaling

(pause)
Because the numbers were not crunched fast enough, (pause) Moore's law came to our rescue and Vertical scaling was invented.
