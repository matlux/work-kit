## "Out of the Tar Pit"

"Out of the Tar Pit" paper gives answers to a fundamental question in software development: is complexity inevitable or can it be avoided? What is complexity in the first place and what are possible remedies. It's co-authored by Peter Marks who leads the FPF team at Barclays, developing languages for modelling Structured Products, and tools for pricing and managing trades, in Haskell. This is an established paper if you want to understand the roots of the software crisis.

## "Simple Made Easy"

Similar flavour of the software crisis problem viewed by Rich Hickey the author of Clojure.
"Simple Made Easy" is a recommended talk which emphasise on the value of simple vs easy (easy can lead to complexity) in order to manage your long term software development.
