3. **Build from Source**:
   If the pre-built binary is not accessible, consider building `osmosisd` from the source code:
   ```sh
   # Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis.git
   cd osmosis

   # Checkout the specific version
   git checkout v25.2.0

   # Build the binary
   make install
   ```


#### Building from Source
```sh
# Install prerequisites
brew install go

# Clone the repository and build
git clone https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis.git
cd osmosis
git checkout v25.2.0
make install
```

By following these steps, you should be able to download and install `osmosisd` successfully.
