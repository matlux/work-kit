ref: https://get.osmosis.zone/

```
source <(curl -sL https://get.osmosis.zone/run)
```

As of 6th July 2024, the provided script is designed to automate the installation of an Osmosis node or client on a computer. Osmosis is a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the Cosmos SDK. The script is written in Python and shell script, and it uses several utilities and libraries to facilitate the installation process. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how the script works and what it does:

### Shell Script
The initial shell script is:
```sh
#!/bin/sh

# run get.osmosis.zone python script
curl -sL https://get.osmosis.zone/install > i.py && python3 i.py

# after completion, source the profile
source ~/.profile
```
This script does the following:
1. Downloads a Python installation script from the URL `https://get.osmosis.zone/install`.
2. Executes the downloaded Python script using `python3`.
3. Sources the user's profile to apply any environment changes made by the Python script.

### Python Script (`i.py`)
The Python script contains the core logic for installing Osmosis. Here's a detailed breakdown:

#### 1. Imports and Constants
The script imports various Python modules, including `os`, `sys`, `argparse`, `subprocess`, `platform`, and others. It defines several constants for default values and available choices for networks, installations, and pruning settings.

#### 2. Argument Parsing
The script uses the `argparse` library to parse command-line arguments, which allow users to customize the installation process. The arguments include options for home directory, moniker, verbosity, overwrite, network, pruning, installation type, binary path, and whether to install cosmovisor or set up a systemd service.

#### 3. Helper Classes and Functions
- **Color Class (`bcolors`)**: Provides ANSI escape codes for colored terminal output.
- **Network Class**: Defines configurations for the mainnet and testnet, including URLs for genesis files, binaries, peers, and snapshots.
- **Utility Functions**: These include functions for clearing the screen, displaying welcome messages, and printing completion messages.

#### 4. User Prompts
The script includes several functions to interact with the user and gather input on installation preferences:
- **`select_install`**: Chooses the type of installation (node, client, or localosmosis).
- **`select_network`**: Selects the network (mainnet or testnet).
- **`select_osmosis_home`**: Chooses the installation directory.
- **`select_moniker`**: Sets the moniker (name) for the node.
- **`select_pruning`**: Configures pruning settings.

#### 5. Installation Steps
- **`initialize_osmosis_home`**: Initializes the Osmosis home directory and sets up the configuration files.
- **`customize_config`**: Customizes the configuration files based on the selected network.
- **`download_binary`**: Downloads the appropriate binary for the selected network and system architecture.
- **`download_genesis`**: Downloads the genesis file for the selected network.
- **`download_addrbook`**: Downloads the address book for the selected network.
- **`download_snapshot`**: Downloads and extracts the blockchain snapshot for quicker synchronization.
- **`download_cosmovisor`**: Installs Cosmovisor, a process manager for blockchain applications.
- **`setup_cosmovisor_service`** and **`setup_osmosisd_service`**: Sets up systemd services to run Osmosis or Cosmovisor as background services on Linux systems.

#### 6. Main Function
The `main` function orchestrates the installation process, starting with a welcome message and then guiding the user through the steps outlined above. Depending on the chosen installation type, it will perform different sets of actions to install and configure the Osmosis node or client.

### Conclusion
This script automates the complex process of setting up an Osmosis node or client by handling tasks such as downloading binaries, configuring files, and setting up services. It provides a user-friendly interface with prompts and options to customize the installation according to the user's needs. By sourcing the user's profile at the end, it ensures that any environment changes take effect immediately.


## Explain what is a moniker in this context?

In the context of the Osmosis installation script, a **moniker** refers to a unique identifier or name assigned to a node within the Osmosis network. Hereâ€™s a more detailed explanation:

### What is a Moniker?

- **Node Identifier**: The moniker is essentially a nickname for your node. It is used to identify your node on the network and differentiate it from other nodes.
- **Human-Readable**: Unlike cryptographic addresses or other technical identifiers, a moniker is human-readable and can be anything you choose, like "MyOsmosisNode" or "Node123".

### Role of Moniker

- **Network Visibility**: When your node interacts with the Osmosis network, the moniker helps other network participants recognize your node. This can be useful for network monitoring, peer discovery, and debugging purposes.
- **Configuration**: During the node initialization process, the moniker is set in the nodeâ€™s configuration files. This helps maintain consistency in identifying the node across various operations.

### Setting the Moniker in the Script

In the provided Python script, the `select_moniker` function allows the user to choose a moniker:

```python
def select_moniker():
    if args.moniker:
        moniker = args.moniker
    else:
        print(bcolors.OKGREEN + f"""
Do you want to use the default moniker?

    1) Yes, use default moniker ({DEFAULT_MONIKER})
    2) No, specify custom moniker

ðŸ’¡ You can specify the moniker using the --moniker flag.
""" + bcolors.ENDC)

        while True:
            choice = input("Enter your choice, or 'exit' to quit: ").strip()

            if choice.lower() == "exit":
                print("Exiting the program...")
                sys.exit(0)

            if choice == Answer.YES:
                moniker = DEFAULT_MONIKER
                break
            elif choice == Answer.NO:
                while True:
                    custom_moniker = input("Enter the custom moniker: ")
                    if custom_moniker.strip() != "":
                        moniker = custom_moniker
                        break
                    else:
                        print("Invalid moniker. Please enter a valid moniker.")
                break
            else:
                print("Invalid choice. Please enter 1 or 2.")

    clear_screen()
    return moniker
```

### Usage in the Script

- **Default Moniker**: The script provides a default moniker (e.g., "osmosis") if the user does not specify one.
- **Custom Moniker**: Users can choose a custom moniker to personalize their node.

### Importance

1. **User-Friendly**: It makes node management more accessible by using a simple, human-readable identifier.
2. **Node Differentiation**: Helps in identifying and managing multiple nodes, especially in a large network with many participants.

In summary, a moniker in the Osmosis network context is a customizable, human-readable name for your node, which aids in its identification and management within the network.


## What is typically the osmosis_home directly?

In the context of the Osmosis blockchain and the installation script, `osmosis_home` refers to the directory on your local file system where the Osmosis node's data and configuration files are stored. This directory is essential for the node's operation, as it contains all necessary files such as the blockchain data, configuration files, logs, and other relevant information.

### Default Location

Typically, the default location for `osmosis_home` is:
```
~/.osmosisd
```

Here's a detailed breakdown of what `osmosis_home` typically includes:

### Contents of `osmosis_home`

1. **`config` Directory**:
   - **`config.toml`**: Configuration file for the node's behavior.
   - **`app.toml`**: Application-specific configuration settings.
   - **`client.toml`**: Client-specific configuration settings.
   - **`genesis.json`**: The genesis file which is the initial state of the blockchain.
   - **`addrbook.json`**: Contains addresses of peer nodes.

2. **`data` Directory**:
   - **Blockchain Data**: Stores the blockchain data, including the state and blocks.
   - **Snapshots**: Any downloaded snapshots for quicker synchronization.

3. **Logs**:
   - **`osmosisd.log`**: Log file containing the output of the running node.

4. **`cosmovisor` Directory** (if cosmovisor is used):
   - **`genesis`**: Directory for the genesis binary.
   - **`upgrades`**: Directory for upgraded binaries.

### Setting and Customizing `osmosis_home`

During the installation process, you can customize the location of `osmosis_home`. The script provides an option to specify a different path if you do not want to use the default location. Here's how it handles this in the script:

```python
def select_osmosis_home():
    """
    Selects the path for running the 'osmosisd init --home <SELECTED_HOME>' command.

    Returns:
        osmosis_home (str): The selected path.

    """
    if args.home:
        osmosis_home = args.home
    else:
        default_home = os.path.expanduser("~/.osmosisd")
        print(bcolors.OKGREEN + f"""
Do you want to install Osmosis in the default location?:

    1) Yes, use default location {DEFAULT_OSMOSIS_HOME} (recommended)
    2) No, specify custom location

ðŸ’¡ You can specify the home using the --home flag.
""" + bcolors.ENDC)

        while True:
            choice = input("Enter your choice, or 'exit' to quit: ").strip()

            if choice.lower() == "exit":
                print("Exiting the program...")
                sys.exit(0)

            if choice == Answer.YES:
                osmosis_home = default_home
                break

            elif choice == Answer.NO:
                while True:
                    custom_home = input("Enter the path for Osmosis home: ").strip()
                    if custom_home != "":
                        osmosis_home = custom_home
                        break
                    else:
                        print("Invalid path. Please enter a valid directory.")
                break
            else:
                print("Invalid choice. Please enter 1 or 2.")

    clear_screen()
    return osmosis_home
```

### Practical Considerations

- **Disk Space**: Ensure that the chosen directory has sufficient disk space, as running a node involves downloading and storing the entire blockchain.
- **Permissions**: The directory should have the appropriate read/write permissions for the user running the node.
- **Backup**: Regularly backup the `osmosis_home` directory to prevent data loss.

### Summary

The `osmosis_home` directory is crucial for the operation of an Osmosis node, storing all necessary configuration and data files. By default, it is located at `~/.osmosisd`, but users have the flexibility to choose a custom location during the installation process.


## Explain How the customize_config step works

The `customize_config` function in the Osmosis installation script is designed to modify configuration files within the `osmosis_home` directory based on the network the node is joining (mainnet or testnet). This ensures that the node connects to the correct network with the appropriate settings. Here's a detailed breakdown of what this step does:

### Function Definition

```python
def customize_config(home, network):
    """
    Customizes the TOML configurations based on the network.

    Args:
        home (str): The home directory.
        network (str): The network identifier.

    """
```

### Main Operations

1. **Patch `client.toml`**:
   - The function first modifies the `client.toml` file to set the correct `chain-id` and `node` address based on whether the network is mainnet or testnet.

2. **Patch `config.toml`** (only for testnet):
   - For testnet, it also modifies the `config.toml` file to set the persistent peers, which are necessary for the node to discover and connect to other nodes in the network.

### Detailed Steps

1. **Load and Modify `client.toml`**:
   - The `client.toml` file contains settings for the node's client.
   - The script reads the file, updates the `chain-id` and `node` fields with values specific to the chosen network, and then writes the changes back to the file.

2. **Load and Modify `config.toml`** (testnet only):
   - The `config.toml` file contains settings for the node's core configuration.
   - For the testnet, the script updates the `persistent_peers` field with a list of peer nodes to ensure the node can connect to the testnet.

### Implementation

Here is the detailed implementation of the `customize_config` function:

```python
def customize_config(home, network):
    """
    Customizes the TOML configurations based on the network.

    Args:
        home (str): The home directory.
        network (str): The network identifier.

    """

    # osmo-test-5 configuration
    if network == NetworkChoice.TESTNET:

        # patch client.toml
        client_toml = os.path.join(home, "config", "client.toml")

        with open(client_toml, "r") as config_file:
            lines = config_file.readlines()

        for i, line in enumerate(lines):
            if line.startswith("chain-id"):
                lines[i] = f'chain-id = "{TESTNET.chain_id}"\n'
            elif line.startswith("node"):
                lines[i] = f'node = "{TESTNET.rpc_node}"\n'

        with open(client_toml, "w") as config_file:
            config_file.writelines(lines)

        # patch config.toml
        config_toml = os.path.join(home, "config", "config.toml")

        peers = ','.join(TESTNET.peers)
        subprocess.run(["sed -i -E 's/persistent_peers = \"\"/persistent_peers = \"" + peers + "\"/g' " + config_toml], shell=True)

    # osmosis-1 configuration
    elif network == NetworkChoice.MAINNET:
        client_toml = os.path.join(home, "config", "client.toml")

        with open(client_toml, "r") as config_file:
            lines = config_file.readlines()

        for i, line in enumerate(lines):
            if line.startswith("chain-id"):
                lines[i] = f'chain-id = "{MAINNET.chain_id}"\n'
            elif line.startswith("node"):
                lines[i] = f'node = "{MAINNET.rpc_node}"\n'

        with open(client_toml, "w") as config_file:
            config_file.writelines(lines)

    else:
        print(bcolors.RED + f"Invalid network {network}. Please choose a valid setting.\n" + bcolors.ENDC)
        sys.exit(1)

    clear_screen()
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Identifying the Network**:
   - The function checks if the network is `TESTNET` or `MAINNET` using the `network` parameter.
   
2. **Modifying `client.toml`**:
   - The `client.toml` file is read, and the `chain-id` and `node` fields are updated.
   - For the testnet:
     ```python
     if line.startswith("chain-id"):
         lines[i] = f'chain-id = "{TESTNET.chain_id}"\n'
     elif line.startswith("node"):
         lines[i] = f'node = "{TESTNET.rpc_node}"\n'
     ```
   - For the mainnet, a similar update is done with `MAINNET.chain_id` and `MAINNET.rpc_node`.
   - The modified lines are then written back to `client.toml`.

3. **Modifying `config.toml`** (Testnet Only):
   - The function constructs a string of peers for the testnet and updates the `persistent_peers` field in `config.toml` using the `sed` command.
     ```python
     peers = ','.join(TESTNET.peers)
     subprocess.run(["sed -i -E 's/persistent_peers = \"\"/persistent_peers = \"" + peers + "\"/g' " + config_toml], shell=True)
     ```

4. **Clearing the Screen**:
   - After making the modifications, the function clears the terminal screen to keep the output clean.

### Summary

The `customize_config` function is an essential step in setting up an Osmosis node, as it ensures the node is correctly configured to join the specified network. By modifying the `client.toml` and `config.toml` files, it sets the necessary parameters for network connection and node identification, making sure the node operates correctly within the chosen network.


## How is the download_binary section working?

The `download_binary` function in the Osmosis installation script is responsible for downloading the correct binary executable (`osmosisd`) for the selected network (mainnet or testnet) and system architecture (e.g., Linux, macOS, ARM, x86_64). This step is crucial because it ensures that the node software is correctly installed on the user's system. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this function works and what it does:

### Function Definition

```python
def download_binary(network):
    """
    Downloads the binary for the specified network based on the operating system and architecture.

    Args:
        network (NetworkChoice): The network type, either MAINNET or TESTNET.

    Raises:
        SystemExit: If the binary download URL is not available for the current operating system and architecture.
    """
```

### Main Operations

1. **Set Binary Path**:
   - The function defines the path where the binary will be installed. By default, this is `/usr/local/bin/osmosisd`.

2. **Check Existing Installation**:
   - It checks if the binary already exists at the specified path and, if so, prompts the user to either skip the download or overwrite the existing binary.

3. **Determine OS and Architecture**:
   - The function identifies the operating system (e.g., Linux, Darwin) and architecture (e.g., x86_64, arm64) of the user's system.

4. **Select Download URL**:
   - Based on the identified OS and architecture, and the chosen network (mainnet or testnet), it selects the appropriate URL for downloading the binary.

5. **Download and Install Binary**:
   - The function downloads the binary using `wget`, sets the necessary permissions, and moves it to the specified path.

6. **Verify Installation**:
   - Finally, it verifies the installation by running a version check on the `osmosisd` binary.

### Detailed Steps

1. **Set Binary Path**:
   ```python
   binary_path = os.path.join(args.binary_path, "osmosisd")
   ```

2. **Check Existing Installation**:
   ```python
   if not args.overwrite:
       try:
           subprocess.run([binary_path, "version"], check=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
           print("osmosisd is already installed at " + bcolors.OKGREEN + f"{binary_path}" + bcolors.ENDC)
           while True:
               choice = input("Do you want to skip the download or overwrite the binary? (skip/overwrite): ").strip().lower()
               if choice == "skip":
                   print("Skipping download.")
                   return
               elif choice == "overwrite":
                   print("Proceeding with overwrite.")
                   break
               else:
                   print("Invalid input. Please enter 'skip' or 'overwrite'.")
       except FileNotFoundError:
           print("osmosisd is not installed. Proceeding with download.")
   ```

3. **Determine OS and Architecture**:
   ```python
   operating_system = platform.system().lower()
   architecture = platform.machine()

   if architecture == "x86_64":
       architecture = "amd64"
   elif architecture == "aarch64":
       architecture = "arm64"

   if architecture not in ["arm64", "amd64"]:
       print(f"Unsupported architecture {architecture}.")
       sys.exit(1)
   ```

4. **Select Download URL**:
   ```python
   if network == NetworkChoice.TESTNET:
       binary_urls = TESTNET.binary_url
   else:
       binary_urls = MAINNET.binary_url

   if operating_system in binary_urls and architecture in binary_urls[operating_system]:
       binary_url = binary_urls[operating_system][architecture]
   else:
       print(f"Binary download URL not available for {operating_system}/{architecture}")
       sys.exit(0)
   ```

5. **Download and Install Binary**:
   ```python
   try:
       print("Downloading " + bcolors.PURPLE + "osmosisd" + bcolors.ENDC, end="\n\n")
       print("from " + bcolors.OKGREEN + f"{binary_url}" + bcolors.ENDC, end=" ")
       print("to " + bcolors.OKGREEN + f"{binary_path}" + bcolors.ENDC)
       print()
       print(bcolors.OKGREEN + "ðŸ’¡ You can change the path using --binary_path" + bcolors.ENDC)

       subprocess.run(["wget", binary_url, "-q", "-O", "/tmp/osmosisd"], check=True)
       os.chmod("/tmp/osmosisd", 0o755)

       if platform.system() == "Linux":
           subprocess.run(["sudo", "mv", "/tmp/osmosisd", binary_path], check=True)
           subprocess.run(["sudo", "chown", f"{os.environ['USER']}:{os.environ['USER']}", binary_path], check=True)
           subprocess.run(["sudo", "chmod", "+x", binary_path], check=True)
       else:
           subprocess.run(["mv", "/tmp/osmosisd", binary_path], check=True)

       # Test binary
       subprocess.run(["osmosisd", "version"], check=True)

       print("Binary downloaded successfully.")

   except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
       print(e)
       print("Failed to download the binary.")
       sys.exit(1)

   clear_screen()
   ```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Binary Path**:
   - The binary will be placed at `args.binary_path` (default is `/usr/local/bin/osmosisd`).

2. **Check Existing Binary**:
   - It attempts to run `osmosisd version` to check if the binary already exists.
   - If it exists and `--overwrite` is not specified, it prompts the user to either skip the download or overwrite the existing binary.

3. **Determine OS and Architecture**:
   - The function uses `platform.system()` to get the OS and `platform.machine()` to get the architecture.
   - It maps common architectures (`x86_64` to `amd64`, `aarch64` to `arm64`).

4. **Select Download URL**:
   - Based on the OS and architecture, it selects the appropriate URL from the `MAINNET` or `TESTNET` configurations.

5. **Download and Install**:
   - It downloads the binary using `wget` and sets it to be executable.
   - On Linux, it uses `sudo` to move the binary to the appropriate path and set the correct permissions.
   - It then verifies the binary by running `osmosisd version`.

### Summary

The `download_binary` function automates the process of downloading and installing the `osmosisd` binary for the correct network and architecture. It ensures that the binary is correctly placed, executable, and verified, thus preparing the system to run an Osmosis node. This step is crucial for setting up a functional node that can participate in the Osmosis network.


## Explain What URLs are used during the download of the binary?

The URLs used in the `download_binary` function are determined based on the chosen network (mainnet or testnet) and the system's operating system and architecture. These URLs point to the locations where the `osmosisd` binary can be downloaded.

Here are the specific URLs used for each combination:

### Mainnet Binary URLs
For mainnet (`osmosis-1`), the URLs are constructed based on the mainnet version (`MAINNET_VERSION`), which is `"25.2.0"` in the script:

- **Linux**:
  - `amd64`: `https://osmosis.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/binaries/v25.2.0/osmosisd-25.2.0-linux-amd64`
  - `arm64`: `https://osmosis.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/binaries/v25.2.0/osmosisd-25.2.0-linux-arm64`

- **Darwin (macOS)**:
  - `amd64`: `https://osmosis.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/binaries/v25.2.0/osmosisd-25.2.0-darwin-amd64`
  - `arm64`: `https://osmosis.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/binaries/v25.2.0/osmosisd-25.2.0-darwin-arm64`

### Testnet Binary URLs
For testnet (`osmo-test-5`), the URLs are similarly constructed based on the testnet version (`TESTNET_VERSION`), which is also `"25.2.0"` in the script:

- **Linux**:
  - `amd64`: `https://osmosis.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/binaries/v25.2.0/osmosisd-25.2.0-linux-amd64`
  - `arm64`: `https://osmosis.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/binaries/v25.2.0/osmosisd-25.2.0-linux-arm64`

- **Darwin (macOS)**:
  - `amd64`: `https://osmosis.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/binaries/v25.2.0/osmosisd-25.2.0-darwin-amd64`
  - `arm64`: `https://osmosis.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/binaries/v25.2.0/osmosisd-25.2.0-darwin-arm64`

### How URLs are Selected in the Script
The script selects the appropriate URL based on the operating system and architecture, and the chosen network (mainnet or testnet):

```python
if network == NetworkChoice.TESTNET:
    binary_urls = TESTNET.binary_url
else:
    binary_urls = MAINNET.binary_url

if operating_system in binary_urls and architecture in binary_urls[operating_system]:
    binary_url = binary_urls[operating_system][architecture]
else:
    print(f"Binary download URL not available for {operating_system}/{architecture}")
    sys.exit(0)
```

### Network Configurations
The `Network` class instances for `TESTNET` and `MAINNET` hold the URLs:

```python
TESTNET = Network(
    chain_id = "osmo-test-5",
    version = f"v{TESTNET_VERSION}",
    genesis_url = "https://osmosis.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/osmo-test-5/genesis.json",
    binary_url = {

### Summary
The URLs used in the script are designed to fetch the `osmosisd` binary for the appropriate network, operating system, and architecture, ensuring that the correct executable is installed for running an Osmosis node. These URLs are stored in the network configuration objects (`TESTNET` and `MAINNET`) and are dynamically selected based on the user's system and network choice.



## How are all those binaries compiled?

The binaries for Osmosis, like `osmosisd`, are compiled from the source code to target different operating systems (OS) and architectures. Here is a detailed explanation of the compilation process:

### Compilation Process

1. **Source Code**: The Osmosis project source code is typically written in Go (Golang). The source code repository is publicly available on platforms like GitHub.

2. **Dependencies**: The project has dependencies that need to be managed. Go modules (`go.mod` and `go.sum` files) handle these dependencies.

3. **Build Scripts**: The project may have build scripts or makefiles that automate the compilation process for different targets.

### Steps to Compile Osmosis Binaries

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Developers clone the Osmosis repository from GitHub.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis.git
   cd osmosis
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Ensure that all dependencies are installed. This can be managed by Goâ€™s module system.
   ```sh
   go mod tidy
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment**:
   - Ensure that Go is installed and set up correctly.
   - Set environment variables if necessary, such as `GOPATH` and `GOBIN`.

4. **Build for Different Architectures and OS**:
   - Use Goâ€™s cross-compilation capabilities to build binaries for different OS and architectures.
   ```sh
   GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o build/osmosisd-linux-amd64 ./cmd/osmosisd
   GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm64 go build -o build/osmosisd-linux-arm64 ./cmd/osmosisd
   GOOS=darwin GOARCH=amd64 go build -o build/osmosisd-darwin-amd64 ./cmd/osmosisd
   GOOS=darwin GOARCH=arm64 go build -o build/osmosisd-darwin-arm64 ./cmd/osmosisd
   ```

5. **Automated Build Systems**:
   - For continuous integration and deployment, automated build systems like GitHub Actions, CircleCI, or Jenkins can be used to automate the build process for each commit or tag.
   - These systems can be configured to build the binaries for all supported platforms and architectures and then upload the artifacts to a storage service (like AWS S3, DigitalOcean Spaces, etc.) or directly to a release page on GitHub.

### Example GitHub Actions Workflow

Here is an example GitHub Actions workflow to build and release Osmosis binaries:

```yaml
name: Build and Release Osmosis Binaries

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*.*.*'

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [linux, darwin]
        arch: [amd64, arm64]

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Go
      uses: actions/setup-go@v2
      with:
        go-version: 1.19

    - name: Build osmosisd
      run: |
        GOOS=${{ matrix.os }} GOARCH=${{ matrix.arch }} go build -o build/osmosisd-${{ matrix.os }}-${{ matrix.arch }} ./cmd/osmosisd

    - name: Upload binaries
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
      with:
        name: osmosisd-${{ matrix.os }}-${{ matrix.arch }}
        path: build/osmosisd-${{ matrix.os }}-${{ matrix.arch }}

  release:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Download binaries
      uses: actions/download-artifact@v2
      with:
        name: osmosisd-linux-amd64
        path: build/

    - name: Create Release
      id: create_release
      uses: actions/create-release@v1
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      with:
        tag_name: ${{ github.ref }}
        release_name: Release ${{ github.ref }}
        draft: false
        prerelease: false

    - name: Upload Release Asset
      uses: actions/upload-release-asset@v1
      with:
        upload_url: ${{ steps.create_release.outputs.upload_url }}
        asset_path: build/
        asset_name: osmosisd
        asset_content_type: application/octet-stream
```

### Summary

The Osmosis binaries are compiled using the Go programming language's cross-compilation features, allowing the creation of executables for multiple operating systems and architectures from a single codebase. The process involves setting up the build environment, managing dependencies, and using build scripts or automated CI/CD pipelines to ensure that the binaries are correctly built and distributed. This ensures that users can easily download and run the Osmosis node software on their preferred platforms.
