## My asset A is value is A. It appreciate i% over t years. what is the value of A after t years?


To calculate the value of asset \( A \) after \( t \) years with an annual appreciation rate of \( i\% \), you can use the formula for compound interest. The formula is:

\[ A_t = A \times (1 + \frac{i}{100})^t \]

where:
- \( A_t \) is the value of the asset after \( t \) years.
- \( A \) is the initial value of the asset.
- \( i \) is the annual appreciation rate (expressed as a percentage).
- \( t \) is the number of years.

### Example Calculation
If the initial value of the asset \( A \) is $1000, the appreciation rate \( i \) is 5%, and the period \( t \) is 10 years, the calculation would be:

1. Convert the appreciation rate to a decimal: \(\frac{5}{100} = 0.05\).
2. Plug the values into the formula:

\[ A_{10} = 1000 \times (1 + 0.05)^{10} \]
\[ A_{10} = 1000 \times (1.05)^{10} \]
\[ A_{10} = 1000 \times 1.62889 \]
\[ A_{10} \approx 1628.89 \]

So, the value of the asset after 10 years would be approximately $1628.89.

Feel free to provide the specific values for \( A \), \( i \), and \( t \) if you would like a specific calculation.
