    :%s/foo/bar/g
        Find each occurrence of 'foo', and replace it with 'bar'.

    :%s/foo/bar/gc
        Change each 'foo' to 'bar', but ask for confirmation first.

    :%s/\<foo\>/bar/gc
        Change only whole words exactly matching 'foo' to 'bar'; ask for confirmation.

    :%s/foo/bar/gci
        Change each 'foo' (case insensitive) to 'bar'; ask for confirmation.
        This may be wanted after using :set noignorecase to make searches case sensitive (the default).

    :%s/foo/bar/gcI
        Change each 'foo' (case sensitive) to 'bar'; ask for confirmation.
        This may be wanted after using :set ignorecase to make searches case insensitive.
